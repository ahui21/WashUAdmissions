        In the wake of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, (<a href="https://github.com/ahui21" class="user-mention">@ahui21</a>) and millions of other Americans were in a state of shock. The man who many pundits said had less than a 5% chance of winning the election had succeeding in doing the impossible: he had convinced hundreds of millions of people that he would be the right choice for this country for the next four years.

      <h3>
        Suddenly, questions that were jokes with friends before became reality in the span of minutes. Questions like:
        <ul>
          <li>What happens to my job now?</li>
          <li>Will my friends be deported?</li>
          <li>What do I do with my healthcare now?</li>
          <li>What does this mean for my taxes?</li>
          <li><b>What does President Trump mean for me?</b></li>
        </ul>
      </h3>

      <h3>
        My goal in creating this website is to elucidate answers to some of these questions. We may have dropped the baton as Americans, but that doesn't mean it's over. The battle may have been lost, but the war is far from over. Let us work together and show the world that one man does not define America &mdash; the 320 million other voices do.
